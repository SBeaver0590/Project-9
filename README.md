# Project-9
 Rest API- In this project I've created a REST API using Express. The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users can interact with the database by getting a list of courses ,as well as adding, updating, and deleting courses from the database.

 To start this project you will need to run npm start in your terminal after downloading the project database to postman.
